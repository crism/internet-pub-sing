# CONTRIBUTING
If you are not comfortable with git and GitHub, please [read these guidelines instead](HowToShare.md).

If you are… please feel free to fork this repository. There’s one folder per song.
## Listen and record
The README for each song should point you to the lead track and any intermediate mixed tracks. Listen to whichever you prefer once or twice. Then, listening with headphones on, record yourself singing along!

You can record audio only or audio-video; if there are enough video recordings, we can do one of those silly tiled videos of the contributors singing.

Don’t worry too much about the quality. If we have dozens of singers, it can’t sound any worse than a real in-person pub sing. :smile:
## Submit
Commit your recording within the song folder. Give it an appropriately indicative name, and also update the README for that song with your name as you prefer to be credited.
