# Internet Pub Sing
A place for bringing songs together while keeping a social distance.
## What is this?
I had this idea several years ago, but in the age of social distance, it seems more pressing than ever.

Lots of us love to sing with other people, but it’s hard to do when we can’t gather in person, and online conferencing brings lag in a way that makes real-time collaboration pretty much impossible.

So instead, let’s try doing it piecemeal. A song leader can post a lead track, and others can record themselves singing along. We’ll mix them and release them.
## How can I participate?
There’s a list of songs below, or you can look at the file browser on the project home page and find the folder for a song there. Download or listen to to the lead track with headphones, record yourself singing along, then share the recording.
