# How to Participate
For those of you not familiar with git or GitHub:

The GitHub interface is very similar to a file explorer you may have used on your Macintosh or Windows computer. There should be one folder per song, and if you navigate to that folder, you should see a list of all the tracks that people have contributed so far.

There should also be an easily-readable README file like this one at the bottom of the page. If there are a lot of contributed tracks, it may be off the screen; just scroll down.
## Listen and record
The README should point you to the lead track and any intermediate mixed tracks. You should be able to download the track you want or play it in your browser. Listen to it once or twice. Then, listening with headphones on, record yourself singing along!

You can record audio only or audio-video; if there are enough video recordings, we can do one of those silly tiled videos of the contributors singing.

Don’t worry too much about the quality. If we have dozens of singers, it can’t sound any worse than a real in-person pub sing. :smile:
## Submit
Send me an e-mail at music@maden.org. Either attach your recording, or send a link to it if you’ve put it somewhere like Dropbox.

You **MUST** include the following in your e-mail!
 * Your name(s) as you wish to be credited.
 * The statement: “I am the author of this recording and I hold its copyright.” (Or a plural version if appropriate.)
 * The statement: “I license this recording under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).” (Or a plural version if appropriate.)
If you do not include those statements, then I do not consider that we have the right to incorporate your recording into a mix.
## Ask for help
If you have any questions or problems, please feel free to e-mail me at music@maden.org.
