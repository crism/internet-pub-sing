# “Keep COVID at Bay”
This is a filk on the Copper family song [“Drive Sorrows Away”](https://mudcat.org/@displaysong.cfm?SongID=1724) for the era of social distancing.

[Folding at Home](https://foldingathome.org/) is the world’s largest supercomputer, and you can join it with your home devices. They work on protein-folding problems, especially currently working on the proteins in SARS-CoV-2. That was the lyrical hook that led me to this song.

## Lyrics
This is one of those songs where the chorus is the last line of the verse repeated. The bold bit below is the chorus. Feel free to sing along to as much or as little as you like, follow the melody or add harmony, whatever.

> The time passes slowly, it’s dreary and gray,
> <br />Since we’ve learned social distance keeps COVID at bay.
> <br />**COVID at bay, COVID at bay, COVID at bay,**
> <br />**Since we’ve learned social distance keeps COVID at bay.**
> 
> If you ask me for masks, you’ll find I have none;
> <br />But with my little laptop, I’m [Folding at Home](https://foldingathome.org/).
> <br />**Folding at Home, Folding at Home, Folding at Home,**
> <br />**But with my little laptop, I’m Folding at Home.**
> 
> Once we gathered with friends and we’d sing until dawn,
> <br />Now the pubs are all closed and the pub sings are gone.
> <br />**Pub sings are gone, pub sings are gone, pub sings are gone,**
> <br />**Now the pubs are all closed and the pub sings are gone.**
> 
> Though our calendar’s empty and our social life’s poor,
> <br />We will sing like we’re singing with thousands or more!
> <br />**Thousands or more, thousands or more, thousands or more,**
> <br />**We will sing like we’re singing with thousands or more!**
> <br />**Thousands or more, thousands or more, thousands or more,**
> <br />**We will sing like we’re singing with thousands or more!**
